	<h1>About Me </h1> 
	<p>Hello, my names is Jared and this is my web GIS website!</p>
  <p>A bit about me, I grew up in the Seattle Area and was fortunate enough to camp and hike a lot as a kid.</p>
  <p> This fostered my love for nature and the outdoors. As someone who wants to protect nature in meaningful ways GIS is extremely powerful.</p>
